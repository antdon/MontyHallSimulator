##The Monty Hall Problem
This application is simulator for the famous problem known as the monty hall problem. The problem refers to Monty Hall, a game show host. For part of his show he would show th audience and a contestant 3 doors and tell them one door has a prize behind it. If the contestant chose the right door he would win the prize. What made it an interesting problem, is that once the contestant picked a door Monty would open one of the two doors that weren't picked bby the contestant to show that the car was not behind that one. He would then ask the contestant if he would like to change his choice to the other still closed door. 
##Application Description
The project so far is split into two scripts. Montyhall.py contains a class representing one instance of the game show. An instance of montyhall takes a boolean representing whether or not the player would like to swap and an integer representing the players guess. The function returns True or False depending on whether the door the player ends up on had the car behind it. Contestant is a class that allows the user to run the game a certain number of times. Contestant takes a parameter runs, that represents the number of times theyd like to run the game. The function call contestant.play() will play the game runs times with both the swap as True and swap as False. It then returns the percentage chance of winning for both "swap" and "stay" represnting changing doors and not changing doors. 
##Usage
The are commented out examples of use inputs at the bottom of each file.
##Findings
Naturally, as would be expected with a reasonable number of trials, swap has aprox 2/3 rate of success and stay has a aprox 1/3 chanve of success.
